This is a little application that produces tiles for an OSM tile
server out of a large png file. It was created to replace and speed up
a script that called convert.

== Profiling ==

The execution speed can be tweaked a little bit by changing the
compression level for zlib (see sources). The default settings give a
good performance with very small resulting tile sizes. Using
Z_BEST_SPEED instead you get about 50% speedup with about 30% larger
file sizes. Z_BEST_COMPRESSION is 3-4 times slower with only about 1%
smaller file size.
